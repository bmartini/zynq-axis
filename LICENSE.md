## License

The source code files within this repo are licensed under a mixture of
different open source licenses.

* device code (in the 'dev' directory) is licensed under the GPLv2 or later
* Xilinx project files (the 'syn/project-* directories) are Licensed by Xilinx
* all other code (e.g. library, applications & hdl) is licensed under MIT.

Due to these different licenses this combined work must be distributed under
the GPLv2 or later. This fact, however, does not affect the licensing of the
individual source files. Thus, if the library or other MIT licensed work is
distributed independently of the device code, it would be done so under the MIT
license.
